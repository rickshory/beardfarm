<h1>The Beard Farm</h1>
<p>I bought this domain a year ago and
haven't done anything with it, so I'm going
to use it to practice web dev.</p>
<p>On a site nobody ever visits, it
doesn't matter if the content
look weird for awhile.</p>
<p>I have a communal house here in Portland.
People call it the "Beard Farm". Why?</p>
<p> Sherlock
Holmes never said "Elementary my dear Watson".
Leo Durocher never said "Nice guys finish
last". I never called my house the "Beard
Farm". But sometimes things just click, and
you've got to go with it.</p>
<p>Calling it a "farm" is like saying it
takes some effort to grow beards. No. Beards
grow on their own. All the effort is in
shaving!</p>
